# Advent of Code 2024

These are my solves of the Advent Of Code 2024 puzzles.
I'm mostly (exclusively?) solving these using rust.
This is fun, disposable code, not production grade stuff, so be prepared to embrace the scruffy!
It is obsessively over-commented, to describe both my thought process, and any quirks of rust that I think are notable.
It may be useful to learn from, if only to learn what not to do.

## Running

To run the code, you need to have rust and cargo installed.
Each day has its own binary, which youc an run like this:

```bash
cargo run --bin day_1 --release
```

This will print out the task 1 and task 2 solutions, but not in any standard format.
